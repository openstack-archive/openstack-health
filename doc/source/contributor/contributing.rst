So You Want to Contribute...
============================

For general information on contributing to OpenStack, please check out the
`contributor guide <https://docs.openstack.org/contributors/>`_ to get started.
It covers all the basics that are common to all OpenStack projects: the accounts
you need, the basics of interacting with our Gerrit review system, how we
communicate as a community, etc.

Below will cover the more project specific information you need to get started
with openstack-health.

Communication

* IRC channel ``#openstack-qa`` at OFTC
* Mailing list (prefix subjects with ``[qa]`` for faster responses)
